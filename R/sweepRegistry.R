#' @title Sweep obsolete files from the file system.
#'
#' @description
#' Removes R scripts, log files, resource informations and temporarily stored configuration files
#' from the registry's file directory. Assuming all your jobs completed successfully, none of these are needed
#' for further work. This operation potentially releases quite a lot of disk space, depending on the number of your jobs.
#' BUT A HUGE WORD OF WARNING:
#' IF you later notice something strange and need to determine the reason for it, you are at a huge disadvantage.
#' Only do this at your own risk and when you are sure that you have successfully completed a project and only
#' want to archive your produced experiments and results.
#'
#' @template arg_reg
#' @param sweep [\code{character}]\cr
#'   Possible choices:
#'   Temporary R scripts of jobs,
#'   really not needed for anything else then execution (\dQuote{scripts}),
#'   log file of jobs,
#'   think about whether you later want to inspect them (\dQuote{logs}),
#'   BatchJobs configuration files which are temporarily stored on submit,
#'   really not needed for anything else then execution (\dQuote{conf}),
#'   resource lists of \code{\link{submitJobs}} which are temporarily stored on submit,
#'   think about whether you later want to inspect them (\dQuote{resources}),
#'   Default is \code{c("scripts", "conf")}.
#' @return [\code{logical}]. Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} on success and \code{FALSE}
#'   if some files could not be removed.
