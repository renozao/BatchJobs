#' Reset computational state of jobs.
#'
#' @description
#' Reset state of jobs in the database. Useful under two circumstances:
#' Either to re-submit them because of changes in e.g. external
#' data or to resolve rare issues when jobs are killed in an unfortunate state
#' and therefore blocking your registry.
#'
#' The function internally lists all jobs on the batch system and
#' if those include some of the jobs you want to reset, it informs you to kill them first by raising
#' an exception.
#' If you really know what you are doing, you may set \code{force} to \code{TRUE} to omit this sanity check.
#' Note that this is a dangerous operation to perform which may harm
#' the database integrity. In this case you HAVE to make externally sure that none of the jobs
#' you want to reset are still running.
#'
#' @template arg_reg
#' @param ids [\code{integer}]\cr
#'   Ids of jobs to kill.
#'   Default is none.
#' @param force [\code{logical(1)}]\cr
#'   Reset jobs without checking whether they are currently running.
#'   READ THE DETAILS SECTION!
#'   Default is \code{FALSE}.
#' @return Vector of reseted job ids.
